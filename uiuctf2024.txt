		unintended solution was just strings grep flag
unsolved attempted in order of confidence/closeness
	new dallas - find the right train bruh wuxi line 2 then baidu to find place
	slot machine - figured out u just had to find a hash w repeating digits at the beginning
		this is done by looking for the lowest hash number since it will have a bunch of 0's 
		then u transform it into a hex lucky number by looking at how bitcoin uses them whichis dumb	
	fare evasion - sqli and token combo
		get token 
		sqli injectioin of md5 hash
		find string or hash that will allow us to inejct 
		1. using 129581926211651571912466741651878684928 as the kid doing sqli
		2. using ffifdyop from hashcrack as bad input we leak the conductor key 
		conductor key is conductor_key_873affdf8cc36a592ec790fc62973d55f4bf43b321bf1ccc0514063370356d5cddb4363b4786fd072d36a25e0ab60a78b8df01bd396c7a05cccbbb3733ae3f8e
		using this in the secret overrides and gives us the flag 
		i was reallly close, just didnt realize the sqli was through the token and not debug

thoughts
  team - ShadowG
  score was 3060 rank 115
